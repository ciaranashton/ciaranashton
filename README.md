# hey, i'm ciaran

i build things — mostly at the intersection of AI and stuff people actually need.

right now i'm working on:

- **[ciaran.ai](https://ciaran.ai)** — my website is sentient (not really, but it thinks it is)
- AI tooling and agents that do real work
- whatever idea won't leave me alone at 2am

### projects

- **[Realy Agent](https://realyagent.com)** — AI-powered real estate agent
- **[Line Items](https://lineitems.ai)** — AI accounting and finance tools
- **[iOS App Trends](https://iosapptrends.com)** — tracking what's happening on the App Store
- **[ciaran.ai](https://ciaran.ai)** — my website is sentient (not really, but it thinks it is)
