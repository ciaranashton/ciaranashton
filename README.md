# hey, i'm ciaran

i build things — mostly at the intersection of AI and stuff people actually need.

right now i'm working on:

- **[ciaran.ai](https://ciaran.ai)** — my website is sentient (not really, but it thinks it is)
- AI tooling and agents that do real work
- whatever idea won't leave me alone at 2am

### what i'm into

`AI` `building in public` `startups` `shipping fast` `typescript` `next.js` `python`

### get in touch

- **x** — [@ciaranashton](https://x.com/ciaranashton)
- **site** — [ciaran.ai](https://ciaran.ai) (it'll talk to you, be nice to it)
